# Debug
- **Debugging** is the process of finding and fixing errors in a computer program.
- **Syntax errors** are the most common type of error. They occur when you don't follow the rules of the programming language.
- **Runtime errors** occur when a program is running and something goes wrong. They are often called exceptions.
- **Logic errors** occur when a program runs but doesn't do what you expect it to do. They are the hardest to find and fix.
- **Debugging tools** are used to help find and fix errors in a program. They include things like print statements, breakpoints, and debuggers.
